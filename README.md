### Hi there, I'm Aleksandr ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a working embedded software developer. 

For the past 10 years, I have been developing embedded systems for home appliances. 
My latest project was an IoT No-Frost refrigerator.

However, in the near future, I would like to switch to web development using Python.

And now I'm actively studying technologies: Django, FastAPI, SQL and etc.
